  
@SCJProtected
----------------------------------------

- can be used only in javax. ... packages
- can not be used both @SCJProtected and @SCJAllowed

- an element with @SCJProtected can be accessed only from scj packages

- if inside @SCJProtected element
	 - you can access other elements in SCJ
	 		e.g. if inside SCJProtected method, you can call any other methods in SCJ packages. (TODO:verify this)


@SCJAllowed
----------------------------------------


0) General Rules
- can not access element that has a lower level
 
 
1) Enclosing Elements
- enclosing element must have the same or lower level than the element itself



2) Classes
    - classes that have no @SCJAllowed (and are not encapsulated by a class having one) are not checked
    - if members=true => un-annotated elements of the class inherit the level of the class
                                            
                       
3) Class inheritance

Table: Class Inheritance, possible @SCJAllowed level combinations
-----------------------
          method   class

parent     1  2     1  2
           ^  ^     ^  ^
           x  |     |  x
child      2  1     2  1

-----------------------

- a class can extend only those classes that have the same or lower level 
  
    
3) Constructors
    - default constructor has the same level as its class
    - no presumption is made upon the non-default constructors
    - super() is handled (can call super constructors that has the same or higher level) 
    
    

4) Methods
- method must have the same or higher level than its class
- a general case of this rule - enclosing element must have the same or lower level than the element itself
 
 
 
5) Method Overriding

Table: Method Overriding
-----------------------
          method   

parent     1  2     
           ^  ^     
           x  |     
child      2  1     

-----------------------
- Method must have the same or lower SCJ-level than all overridden methods.
